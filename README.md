# Visual Explanations for FCNN (GIF Animations)

This repository contains Python scripts that generate animated GIFs illustrating and visualizing the training process described in the following paper:

> **Constructive algorithm for fully connected cascade feedforward
neural networks**  
> Qiao et al., Neurocomputing (2015)  
> [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231215019116](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231215019116)

The goal of this project is to provide intuitive, visual explanations of the main ideas presented in the paper, making them easier to understand for students, researchers, and practitioners.

This project is intended for **educational and demonstrational purposes only**.
